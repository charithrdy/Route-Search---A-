Logic used for A-Star:
    1) Heuristic for Distance:
       - Calculated heuristic as - Since the displacement is always <= to the road distance, calculated displacement between the
           current city to goal city using the latitudes, longitudes given in the city-gps.txt file and used it as heuristic value.
       - Used haversine formula to calculate the displacement -- Mentioned the reference in the 'calDisplacement' function.

        Handling the data inconsistency:
            - Problem with calculating the displacements was that the given data doesn't have lat, lon values of all cities.
            - In that case, I considered the city which is nearest to it by road distance by iterating through it's succesors/predecessors.
            - Again, one more problem here. If none of it's nearby cities have the lat, lon data; then I considered the lat, lon average
               of that state in which city is present and calculated distance using that.
            - Yet again, faced few problems because of invalid state names like Jct_34&56. There are cases where the none of the cities in a
               particular state are mentioned in the city-gps.txt file. In that case, average can't be calculated.
            - So, to tackle the above problem, while iterating, i'm storing the previous city in the route and using it's lat, lon values.

    2) Heuristic for Time:
        - Calculated heuristic as - Distance(heuristic value as caluculated above) / Average speed of all routes in the given data.
        - Average speeds of all routes given in the data seemed to be the best option as the denominator, as we are neither aware of the upcoming route,
           nor can rely on the route followed till now, as the speeds keeps changing based on states and highways.

        Handling the data inconsistency:
            - Problem here was that few routes were missing speed values or have the speed values as '0'.
            - So to handle this problem, i've replaced 0s and missing speeds with average speed in that particular highway,
               rather than overall avergae. If that highway does not occur in any other route, then using the over all avergae speed instead.

    3) Heuristic for Segments:
        - Calculated the heuristic as - Distance(heuristic value as caluculated above) / Average distance of all routes
        - Intuition behind this is that, by diving heuristic distance value with average distance, we get
           the estimated number of segments.


Although the heuristics seems to be good enough and data inconsisties handled properly, but still was not able to get optimal answers as compared to UCS.

I have identified that the latitudes, longitudes data given in the file itself are wrong or the road distance values in the road-segments.txt file are wrong. They give the displacement values higher than the road distances, thus making the heuristic inadmissible and not able to produce optimal results.
